The following will give you a project that is set up and ready to use (don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site). The `hugo server` command builds and serves the site. If you just want to build the site, run `hugo` instead.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git && \
cd docsy-example && \
npm install && \
hugo server
```
